In this lesson, I have learned about the Positive and Negative  
Integers. Positive integers are whole numbers greater than zero, while negative  
integers are whole numbers less than zero. All numbers to the right of 0 on a hori-  
zontal line and above 0 on a vertical line are called positive integers, they are  
all greater than 0 and all the negative integers. Their values increase the  
farther they are to the right on a horizontal number line or the higher they  
are on a vertical number line. All the numbers to the left of 0 or below 0  
are called negative integers, they are all less than 0 and all the positive integers.  
Their values decrease the farther they are to the left on a horizontal number line  
or the lower they are on a vertical number line. To arrange the positive and  
negative integers in ascending and descending orders you need to understand the  
concept of a number line and the relationship between positive and negative numbers.  
To accurately add, subtract, multiply and divide integers for addition and subtrac-  
tion, if the signs are the same, add the absolute values and keep the same  
sign of the larger number. For multiplication and division, if the sign are the same,  
the result is positive. If the sign are different the result is negative. To solve  
word problems involving addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of integers:  
Find out the given facts, find what is asked in the problem, also determine  
the operation to be used and write down the number sentence.  

What is the importance of these concepts?
