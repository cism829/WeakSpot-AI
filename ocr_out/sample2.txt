we, could drop the x, subtracted from larger pressure values, thus, simplifying the math for a quadratic equation, it does not necessarily correspond to less than 5 anymore, since the stoichiometry of our gas reactions may not be (?). 

Q. Consider the equilibrium:  
H₂(g) + I₂(g) ⇌ 2HI(g) Kp = 113 at 555 K  

A chemist adds 9.3 atm of H₂ and 5.0 atm of I₂ to a sealed reaction vessel (let 550.0 L and allow it to come to equilibrium, based on the reaction above. Determine the partial pressure of each gas at equilibrium.  

1. Kp = (PHI)²  
2. The reaction has to go in a forward direction because only reactants added.  
3. R = P H₂ = 9.3 atm, P I₂ = 5.0 atm, P HI = 0 atm.  

Here, P = 9.5 atm for each reactant, so 400 x 113 = 45000 so no, we cannot drop the x to simply.
