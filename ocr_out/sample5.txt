Answer (b)

Bama was in third grade when she first understood 
the meaning of the word untouchability. Bama was 
returning home from school when she saw an elderly 
man of her community carrying a parcel in his hand 
but in a very strange manner that he was holding the 
parcel by barely touching the string of the parcel. She 
was shocked why Bama's brother Anna explained her that 
it is not funny. He further explained to her that he belongs 
to a lower caste that is why he is holding the parcel like 
that. It is believed that if he would hold the parcel 
normally, the good could become untouchable. Bama 
was shocked to hear this. Her brother told her that 
untouchability is deeply rooted in our society and 
education is the only way to break this cycle. He 
encouraged Bama to study well and chase everyone 
her worth. Bama decided to study well and fight against 
the discrimination of caste and untouchability.
