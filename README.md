### What is WeakSpot AI?
WeakSpot-AI is a web-based educational application where students can create study groups, upload their handwritten or typed notes to a persistent database, and generate usable study materials based on those notes. The goal is to implement AI in education in a way that fosters deeper learning, encourages retrieval practice, and avoids the common pitfall of AI simply giving out full answers. Instead, the system focuses on generating questions, concise explanations, and actionable feedback so students can identify and strengthen their “weak spots.” 

## How to run 
1) In one terminal run `npm install` to download all of the requirements and dependencies 
2) Within the same terminal, run `npm run dev` to start the frontend server 
3) Create a new terminal and in that terminal, run `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000` for the backend
