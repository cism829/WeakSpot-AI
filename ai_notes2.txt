● Was proposed to transform static L.M.into dynamic goal-driven entities capable of
addressing more complex problems than typical NLP tasks
Intelligent Agent (AI Agent)
● An entity that perceives its environment, takes actions autonomously to achieve goals
● May improve knowledge through machine learning or aby cquiring knowledge
Why
● Faster
● Increased efficency through automated tasks
● Can procss large amounts of data quickly and respon promptly
● Ideal for fast decision making
Agent ≠ Application
● An agent acts on behalf of user with a degree of autonomy
○ May be seen as the next generation of due to
● An application performs a specific task or set of tasks for a user

○ Task: book a flight & find hotel
○ Details: departure/arrival
2. Planning (GOal Decmp + Strat)
○
3. Memory (Tascking state and context)
○ Preferred airlines or hotels
4. Tools (Action Execution in the Real World)
○ Various APIs
LangChain
● Most popular modular agent construction
● Built around 3 core components
AutoGen
● Framework for creating mulit-agent AI applications that can act autonomously
