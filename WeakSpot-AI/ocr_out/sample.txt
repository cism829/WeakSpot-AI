Electromagnetic Induction
           Faraday's and Lenz's Law

Definition
- Electromagnetic induction refers to the production of an induced 
  EMF (electromagnetic force).
  1. EMF can be thought of as a voltage or potential difference 
     induced in a conductor as a result of the relative 
     motion of a magnet and a coil.
  2. If there is a closed circuit, an induced current will be 
     produced.

Motion of conductor/charges → Force on moving charges
- Creation of a potential separation of (F = qE) 
  (causes a current in an enclosed circuit)

Faraday's Law
Michael Faraday performed a series of experiments that 
showed an EMF induced in a circuit when it 
experiences a change in magnetic flux.
1. Magnetic flux: A measure of the total number of 
   magnetic field lines that pass through a chosen 
   surface area.
   Φ = B·A

Faraday's law can be stated as follows:
2. An EMF is induced whenever a circuit experiences a 
   change of magnetic flux, and the EMF induced in a 
   circuit is directly proportional to the rate of change 
   of magnetic flux through the circuit.
   ε = -ΔΦ/Δt = -Δ(B·A)/Δt

Induced EMF
- The magnitude of ε varies with time.
- The area of the circuit can change with time.
- The angle between B and the normal to the plane 
  changes with time.
