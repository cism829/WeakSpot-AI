Dr. E.F. Codd is an IBM researcher (who  
first developed the relational data  
model in 1970.  
In 1985, Dr. Codd published a list of 12  
rules that define an ideal relational  
database and has provided a guideline  
for the design of all relational database SIM.  

Rule 1: The Information Rule  
This rule simply requires that all data  
should be presented in table form. This  
is the basis of relational model.  

Rule 2: Guaranteed Access Rule  
Every single data element (value) is  
guaranteed to be accessible logically with  
a combination of table-name (table)  
key (row value) and attribute-name (column value).  

Rule 3: Systematic Treatment of Null Value

Rule 4: Active Online Catalog  
The structure description of the online database  
must be stored in an online catalog known  
as data dictionary... which can be...
