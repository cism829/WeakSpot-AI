qatarí Literature traces its origin back to the 19th century.  
Originally, written poetry was the most common form of  
expression, but poetry later fell out of favour. After  
Qatar began reaping profits from oil exports in the mid-  
20th century and many Qataris abandoned their Bedouin traditions  
in favour of more urban lifestyles.  

Due to the increasing number of Qataris who began receiving  
formal education in the 1950's and other significant societal  
changes, the following years saw the introduction of  
short stories and later, novels. Poetry, particularly the  
predominant nabati form, retained some importance but would  
soon be overshadowed by other literacy types. Unlike  
most other forms of art in qatarí literature society,  
females have been involved in the modern literature  
movement on a similar magnitude to males.  

Although poetry no longer dwarfs other literary forms  
in importance, it is still a long honoured tradition  
which has attracted new writers in the mid- and late-1900s  
and even into the 21st century. Poets such as Sheikh Mubarak  
bin Saif Al Thani, Hassan Al Nama and Hajar Ahmed Hajar were  
prominent figures in the late 1900s. Around this time, females  
such as Kaltham Jaber, Hessa Al Awadhi and Zakia Mallah  
also started composing poet(?) poems. Poems were being published
