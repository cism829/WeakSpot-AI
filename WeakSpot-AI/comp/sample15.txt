Dr E.F. Codd is an IBM researcher who
first developed the relational data
model in 1970.

In 1985, Dr. Codd published a list of 12
rules that define an ideal relational
database and has provided a guideline
for the design of all relational database sim.

Rule 1: The Information Rule
This rule simply requires that all data 
should be presented in table form. This
is the basis of relational model.

Rule 2: Guaranteed Access Rule
Every single data element (value) is
guaranteed to be accessible logically with
a combination of table-name, primary-
key (row value) and attribute-name(column value).

Rule 3 : Systematic Treatment of Null value
The null values in a database must be given
a systematic and uniform treatment. This
is very important Rule because a NULL can 
be interpreted as one of the following -
data is missing, data is not known or
data is not applicable

Rule 4: Active Online Catalog
The structure description of the entire database 
must be stored in an online catalog, known
as data dictionary, which can be
