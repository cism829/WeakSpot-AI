Electromagnetic Induction
           Faraday's and Lenz's Law
Definition
- Electromagnetic induction refers to the production of an induced 
  EMF (electromagnetic force).
  ↳ EMF can be thought of as a voltage or potential difference 
     induced in a conductor as a result of the relative 
     motion of a magnet and a coil.
  ↳ If there is a closed circuit, an induced current will be 
     produced.

Motion of conductor/charges → Force on moving charges
  ↳ creation of a potential separation of (F = qE)
     (causes a current in an enclosed circuit)

Faraday's Law
Michael Faraday performed a series of experiments that 
showed an EMF induced in a circuit when it 
experiences change in magnetic flux.
↳ Magnetic flux: A measure of the total number of 
   magnetic field lines that pass through a chosen 
   surface area.
   Φ = B·A

Faraday's law can be stated as follows:
↳ An EMF is induced whenever a circuit experiences 
   change of magnetic flux, and the EMF induced in a 
   circuit is directly proportional to the rate of change 
   of magnetic flux through the circuit.
   ε = -ΔΦ/Δt
   Induced EMF

- The magnitude of ε varies with time.
- The area of the circuit can change with time.
- The angle between B and the normal to the plane 
  changes with time.
