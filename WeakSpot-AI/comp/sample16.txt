accessed by authorized users.
Users can use the same query language to
access the catalog which they used to access
the database itself.

Rule 5: Comprehensive Data Sub-Language Rule
A database can only be accessed using
a language having linear syntax that support
data definition, data manipulation and
transaction management operations.
All commercial relational databases use forms
of SQL as their supported language.

Rule 6: View Updating Rule
Data can be presented in different
logical combinations called views
each view should support the same full 
range of data manipulation that has direct 
access to a table available.

Rule 7: High Level Insert, Update and Delete
A database must support high-level
insertion, updating, and deletion. This must
not be limited to a single row, that is
it must also support union, intersection
and minus operations to yield sets of
data records.

Rule 8: Physical Data Independence
The data stored in a database must be
independent of the applications that access 
the database
