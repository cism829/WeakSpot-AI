Experiment 11
Topic: Measurement of Memory by Recall Method.
Problem:
To measure memory by recall method using meaningless
(non-sense syllables) and meaningful words.
Introduction:
Memory is inferred by comparing how much is remembered 
and how much has been forgotten. In other words,
memory is revival of ideas, mental images of objects
and events that we have experienced before. So, we
can say memory is the ability to retain and reproduce
information when required.
Measurement of memory and its types have always been 
the favourite subjects of the psychologists, therefore
according to them remembering involves those processes
which are essential for memory. Basically, there appear to
be three different memory systems.
1: Sensory Information Storage:
This is the first system of memory which maintains 
sensory information just long enough to be used in
perceiving, judging and remembering. It usually lasts
for less than half a second.
