Qatari literature traces its origin back to the 19th century. 
Originally, written poetry was the most common form of expression, but poetry later fell out of favour after Qatar began reaping profits from oil exports in the mid-20th century and many qataris abandoned their bedovin traditions in favour of more urban lifestyles.

Due to the increasing number of Qataris who began receiving formal education in the 1950's and other significant societal changes, the following years saw the introduction of short stories, and later, novels. Poetry, particularly the predominant nabati form, retained some importance but would soon be overshadowed by other literary types. Unlike most other forms of art in Qatari society, females have been involved in the modern literature movement on a similar magnitude to males.

Although poetry no longer dwarfs other literary forms in importance, it is still a long honoured tradition which has attracted new writers in the mid and late 1900s, and even into the 21st century.

Around this time females such as Kaltham Jaber, Hessa AlAwadhi and Zakia Mallah also started composing poems. Poems were being published
